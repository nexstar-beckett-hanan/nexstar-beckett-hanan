Hey! I'm Beckett. I'm a Sr. Frontend Software Engineer who prioritizes accessibility in every role and project I take on.

Iâ€™ve got a couple personal projects I work on when I have time:
<ul>
<li>The first is called CodeMapper. It allows you to get a high-level overview of a project. It's ideal for projects with a lot of JavaScript and we're working to make the results easier to understand if you have trouble seeing the visualizations.</li>
<li>The second can be found at <a href="http://www.crushwhitesupremacy.com">www.crushwhitesupremacy.com</a> and is a quick way to get a recommendation for an anti-racist action you can take with the specific amount of time or money you currently have available. At the moment it's fairly simple, but the goal is to expand the database of possible actions and customize things using additional prompts so that everyone can have practical, accessible suggestions offered to them.</li>
</ul>

I'd love to collaborate on projects that prioritize access to important services or resources, or anything that could use an eye for better accessibility. If you have something you could use my support on, let's chat and I'll let you know if I can help.
