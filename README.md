Hey! I'm Beckett. My pronouns are they/them or he/him.
I'm a Frontend Software Engineer III at Nexstar Media.

I’ve got a couple personal projects I work on when I have time:
<ul>
<li>The first is called CodeMapper. It allows you to get a high-level overview of a project. It's ideal for projects with a lot of JavaScript and we're working to make the results easier to understand if you have trouble seeing the visualizations.</li>
<li>The second can be found at <a href="http://www.crushwhitesupremacy.com">www.crushwhitesupremacy.com</a> and is a quick way to get a recommendation for an anti-racist action you can take with the specific amount of time or money you currently have available. At the moment it's fairly small, but the goal is to expand the database of possible actions and customize things using additional prompts so that everyone can have useful suggestions offered to them.</li>
</ul>

I'd love to collaborate on projects with a focus on making the web more accessible. If you have something you could use my support on, let me know and I'd love to jump in if I have time!

I’m also looking for help with crushwhitesupremacy.com - I have a lot of actions that need to be sorted in an excel sheet or added directly to the database so the frontend knows who to offer them to.
